# Pinecone Vector Data Operations

This repository provides a simple example of working with vector data using Pinecone. Pinecone is a vector database that allows you to index, search, and retrieve high-dimensional vector data efficiently using similarity search.

## Getting Started

To get started with Pinecone vector data operations, follow the instructions below.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Python 3.x
- Pinecone Python SDK (`pinecone-client`)

You can install the Pinecone Python SDK using pip:

```bash
pip install pinecone-client
```
## Usage

__Initialize the Pinecone environment :__
```python
import pinecone

pinecone.init(api_key="<YOUR_API_KEY>")
```

### Create an index
To create an index in the vector database, you can follow the following example:
```python
pinecone.create_index(index_name="<YOUR_INDEX_NAME>")
```

### Inserting Data
You can insert vector data into a Pinecone index using the upsert method. Here's an example of inserting a vector with an associated ID into the index:
```python
pinecone.upsert(index_name="<YOUR_INDEX_NAME>", data=[("<VECTOR_ID>", [<DATA_ARRAY>])])
```
### Querying Data
You can perform similarity searches on your data in Pinecone using the query method. Here's an example of querying the index for similar vectors:
```python
results = pinecone.query(index_name="<YOUR_INDEX_NAME>", query_vector=[0.1, 0.2, 0.3], top_k=5)
```

### Deleting an Index
To delete an index, use the delete_index method:
```python
pinecone.delete_index(index_name="<YOUR_INDEX_NAME>")
```
## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! If you have any improvements or additional features you'd like to add, please open an issue or submit a pull request.


Remember to replace `<YOUR_API_KEY>` and `<YOUR_INDEX_NAME>` with your actual Pinecone API key and the desired index name. This README provides a basic outline of how to work with Pinecone vector data and can be expanded upon as needed for your specific use case.
